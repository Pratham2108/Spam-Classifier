# Spam-Classifier
The project uses knowledge of the programming language named Python and its various useful ML and NLP related libraries.

For the purpose of debugging, reference and syntax check, I have used documentation of the libraries mentioned ahead and also online communities like StackOverflow, TowardsDatascience, GeeksforGeeks, Youtube channels like Krish Naik and others I may have missed. I am grateful for these platforms and would like to thank them for helping me complete the project.
